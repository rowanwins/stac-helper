A small-ish (< 15kb minified) library for helping interacting with [STAC documents](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec) and [STAC API](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec) endpoints in a web browser. 

Note: Uses the [`Fetch API`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) for making requests, so if you'd like to use it in NodeJS then you'll need to use a polyfill like isomorphic-fetch which makes Fetch available as a global.
